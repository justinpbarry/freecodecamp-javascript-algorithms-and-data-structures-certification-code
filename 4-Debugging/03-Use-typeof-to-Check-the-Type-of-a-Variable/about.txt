Debugging: Use typeof to Check the Type of a Variable
You can use typeof to check the data structure, or type, of a variable. This is useful in debugging when working with multiple data types. If you think you're adding two numbers, but one is actually a string, the results can be unexpected. Type errors can lurk in calculations or function calls. Be careful especially when you're accessing and working with external data in the form of a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) object.

Here are some examples using typeof:

console.log(typeof ""); // outputs "string"
console.log(typeof 0); // outputs "number"
console.log(typeof []); // outputs "object"
console.log(typeof {}); // outputs "object"
JavaScript recognizes six primitive (immutable) data types: Boolean, Null, Undefined, Number, String, and Symbol (new with ES6) and one type for mutable items: Object. Note that in JavaScript, arrays are technically a type of object.


Add two console.log() statements to check the typeof each of the two variables seven and three in the code.

Your code should use typeof in two console.log() statements to check the type of the variables.
Your code should use typeof to check the type of the variable seven.
Your code should use typeof to check the type of the variable three.
