Object Oriented Programming: Add Methods After Inheritance
A constructor function that inherits its prototype object from a supertype constructor
 function can still have its own methods in addition to inherited methods.

For example, Bird is a constructor that inherits its prototype from Animal:

function Animal() { }
Animal.prototype.eat = function() {
  console.log("nom nom nom");
};
function Bird() { }
Bird.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
Bird.prototype.constructor = Bird;
In addition to what is inherited from Animal, you want to add behavior that is unique
 to Bird objects. Here, Bird will get a fly() function. Functions are added to Bird's
  prototype the same way as any constructor function:

Bird.prototype.fly = function() {
  console.log("I'm flying!");
};
Now instances of Bird will have both eat() and fly() methods:

let duck = new Bird();
duck.eat(); // prints "nom nom nom"
duck.fly(); // prints "I'm flying!"

Add all necessary code so the Dog object inherits from Animal and the Dog's prototype
 constructor is set to Dog. Then add a bark() method to the Dog object so that beagle
  can both eat() and bark(). The bark() method should print "Woof!" to the console.

Animal should not respond to the bark() method.
Dog should inherit the eat() method from Animal.
Dog should have the bark() method as an own property.
beagle should be an instanceof Animal.
The constructor for beagle should be set to Dog.

CODE

function Animal() { }
Animal.prototype.eat = function() { console.log("nom nom nom"); };

function Dog() { }

// Add your code below this line




// Add your code above this line

let beagle = new Dog();

beagle.eat(); // Should print "nom nom nom"
beagle.bark(); // Should print "Woof!"
