Object Oriented Programming: Use Dot Notation to Access the Properties of an Object
The last challenge created an object with various properties, now you'll see how to
access the values of those properties. Here's an example:

let duck = {
  name: "Aflac",
  numLegs: 2
};
console.log(duck.name);
// This prints "Aflac" to the console
Dot notation is used on the object name, duck,
followed by the name of the property, name, to access the value of "Aflac".


Print both properties of the dog object below to your console.

Your should use console.log to print the value for the name property of the dog object.
Your should use console.log to print the value for the numLegs property of the dog object.
