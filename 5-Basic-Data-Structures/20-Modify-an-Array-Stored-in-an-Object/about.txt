Basic Data Structures: Modify an Array Stored in an Object
Now you've seen all the basic operations for JavaScript objects. You can add, modify, and remove key-value pairs,
check if keys exist, and iterate over all the keys in an object. As you continue learning JavaScript you will see
even more versatile applications of objects. Additionally, the optional Advanced Data Structures lessons later in
the curriculum also cover the ES6 Map and Set objects, both of which are similar to ordinary objects but provide
some additional features. Now that you've learned the basics of arrays and objects, you're fully prepared to begin
tackling more complex problems using JavaScript!


Take a look at the object we've provided in the code editor. The user object contains three keys.
The data key contains five keys, one of which contains an array of friends. From this, you can see
how flexible objects are as data structures. We've started writing a function addFriend.
Finish writing it so that it takes a user object and adds the name of the friend argument to the array stored
in user.data.friends and returns that array.

The user object has name, age, and data keys
The addFriend function accepts a user object and a friend string as arguments and adds the friend to the array of friends in the user object
addFriend(user, "Pete") should return ["Sam", "Kira", "Tomo", "Pete"]
