Basic Data Structures: Iterate Through the Keys of an Object with a for...in Statement
Sometimes you may need to iterate through all the keys within an object. This requires a specific syntax in JavaScript called a for...in statement. For our users object, this could look like:

for (let user in users) {
  console.log(user);
};

// logs:
Alan
Jeff
Sarah
Ryan
In this statement, we defined a variable user, and as you can see, this variable was reset during each iteration to each of the object's keys as the statement looped through the object, resulting in each user's name being printed to the console.

NOTE:
Objects do not maintain an ordering to stored keys like arrays do; thus a keys position on an object, or the relative order in which it appears, is irrelevant when referencing or accessing that key.


We've defined a function, countOnline; use a for...in statement within this function to loop through the users in the users object and return the number of users whose online property is set to true.

The users object contains users Jeff and Ryan with online set to true and users Alan and Sarah with online set to false
The function countOnline returns the number of users with the online property set to true

below is the original code that comes along with this challenge
CODE

let users = {
  Alan: {
    age: 27,
    online: false
  },
  Jeff: {
    age: 32,
    online: true
  },
  Sarah: {
    age: 48,
    online: false
  },
  Ryan: {
    age: 19,
    online: true
  }
};

function countOnline(obj) {
  // change code below this line

  // change code above this line
}

console.log(countOnline(users));
