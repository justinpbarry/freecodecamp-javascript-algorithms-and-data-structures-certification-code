Basic Data Structures: Modify an Object Nested Within an Object
Now let's take a look at a slightly more complex object. Object properties can be nested to an arbitrary depth, and their values can be any type of data supported by JavaScript, including arrays and even other objects. Consider the following:

let nestedObject = {
  id: 28802695164,
  date: 'December 31, 2016',
  data: {
    totalUsers: 99,
    online: 80,
    onlineStatus: {
      active: 67,
      away: 13
    }
  }
};
nestedObject has three unique keys: id, whose value is a number, date whose value is a string, and data, whose value is an object which has yet another object nested within it. While structures can quickly become complex, we can still use the same notations to access the information we need.


Here we've defined an object, userActivity, which includes another object nested within it. You can modify properties on this nested object in the same way you modified properties in the last challenge. Set the value of the online key to 45.

userActivity has id, date and data properties
userActivity has a data key set to an object with keys totalUsers and online
The online property nested in the data key of userActivity should be set to 45
The online property is set using dot or bracket notation
