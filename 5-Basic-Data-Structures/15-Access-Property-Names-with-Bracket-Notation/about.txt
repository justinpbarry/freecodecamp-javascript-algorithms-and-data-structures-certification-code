Basic Data Structures: Access Property Names with Bracket Notation
In the first object challenge we mentioned the use of bracket notation as a way to access property values using the evaluation of a variable. For instance, imagine that our foods object is being used in a program for a supermarket cash register. We have some function that sets the selectedFood and we want to check our foods object for the presence of that food. This might look like:

let selectedFood = getCurrentFood(scannedItem);
let inventory = foods[selectedFood];
This code will evaluate the value stored in the selectedFood variable and return the value of that key in the foods object, or undefined if it is not present. Bracket notation is very useful because sometimes object properties are not known before runtime or we need to access them in a more dynamic way.


We've defined a function, checkInventory, which receives a scanned item as an argument. Return the current value of the scannedItem key in the foods object. You can assume that only valid keys will be provided as an argument to checkInventory.

checkInventory is a function
The foods object should have only the following key-value pairs: apples: 25, oranges: 32, plums: 28, bananas: 13, grapes: 35, strawberries: 27
checkInventory("apples") should return 25
checkInventory("bananas") should return 13
checkInventory("strawberries") should return 27

below is the original code that comes along with this challenge
CODE
let foods = {
  apples: 25,
  oranges: 32,
  plums: 28,
  bananas: 13,
  grapes: 35,
  strawberries: 27
};
// do not change code above this line

function checkInventory(scannedItem) {
  // change code below this line

}

// change code below this line to test different cases:
console.log(checkInventory("apples"));
