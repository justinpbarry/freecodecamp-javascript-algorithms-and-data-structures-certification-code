Basic JavaScript: Understanding Undefined Value returned from a Function
A function can include the return statement but it does not have to. In the case that the function doesn't have a return statement, when you call it, the function processes the inner code but the returned value is undefined.

Example

var sum = 0;
function addSum(num) {
  sum = sum + num;
}
var returnedValue = addSum(3); // sum will be modified but returned value is undefined
addSum is a function without a return statement. The function will change the global sum variable but the returned value of the function is undefined


Create a function addFive without any arguments. This function adds 5 to the sum variable, but its returned value is undefined.


addFive should be a function
sum should be equal to 8
Returned value from addFive should be undefined
Inside of your functions, add 5 to the sum variable
