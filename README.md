# freecodecamp-javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-certification-code
This repository contains some of my code the for JavaScript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification (300 hours)on https://learn.freecodecamp.org/. This is meant to document my learning. If you are learning on freecodecamp, ideally you should figure out the code by yourself. If you just copy this code, you won't learn as well as if you attempted yourself.  This file was made on 2019-05-29. I am currently working on the #100daysofcode challenge. See my website at https://justinpbarry.com
