Regular Expressions: Match Anything with Wildcard Period
Sometimes you won't (or don't need to) know the exact characters in your patterns. Thinking of all words that match, say, a misspelling would take a long time. Luckily, you can save time using the wildcard character: .

The wildcard character . will match any one character. The wildcard is also called dot and period. You can use the wildcard character just like any other character in the regex. For example, if you wanted to match "hug", "huh", "hut", and "hum", you can use the regex /hu./ to match all four words.

let humStr = "I'll hum a song";
let hugStr = "Bear hug";
let huRegex = /hu./;
humStr.match(huRegex); // Returns ["hum"]
hugStr.match(huRegex); // Returns ["hug"]

Complete the regex unRegex so that it matches the strings "run", "sun", "fun", "pun", "nun", and "bun". Your regex should use the wildcard character.

You should use the .test() method.
You should use the wildcard character in your regex unRegex
Your regex unRegex should match "run" in "Let us go on a run."
Your regex unRegex should match "sun" in "The sun is out today."
Your regex unRegex should match "fun" in "Coding is a lot of fun."
Your regex unRegex should match "pun" in "Seven days without a pun makes one weak."
Your regex unRegex should match "nun" in "One takes a vow to be a nun."
Your regex unRegex should match "bun" in "She got fired from the hot dog stand for putting her hair in a bun."
Your regex unRegex should not match "There is a bug in my code."
Your regex unRegex should not match "Catch me if you can."
