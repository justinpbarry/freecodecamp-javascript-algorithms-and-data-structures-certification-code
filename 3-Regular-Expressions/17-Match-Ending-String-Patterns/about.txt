Regular Expressions: Match Ending String Patterns
In the last challenge, you learned to use the caret character to search for patterns at the beginning of strings. There is also a way to search for patterns at the end of strings.

You can search the end of strings using the dollar sign character $ at the end of the regex.

let theEnding = "This is a never ending story";
let storyRegex = /story$/;
storyRegex.test(theEnding);
// Returns true
let noEnding = "Sometimes a story will have to end";
storyRegex.test(noEnding);
// Returns false

Use the anchor character ($) to match the string "caboose" at the end of the string caboose.

You should search for "caboose" with the dollar sign $ anchor in your regex.
Your regex should not use any flags.
You should match "caboose" at the end of the string "The last car on a train is the caboose"
