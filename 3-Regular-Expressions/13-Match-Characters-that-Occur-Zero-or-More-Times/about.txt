Regular Expressions: Match Characters that Occur Zero or More Times
The last challenge used the plus + sign to look for characters that occur one or more times. There's also an option that matches characters that occur zero or more times.

The character to do this is the asterisk or star: *.

let soccerWord = "gooooooooal!";
let gPhrase = "gut feeling";
let oPhrase = "over the moon";
let goRegex = /go*/;
soccerWord.match(goRegex); // Returns ["goooooooo"]
gPhrase.match(goRegex); // Returns ["g"]
oPhrase.match(goRegex); // Returns null

Create a regex chewieRegex that uses the * character to match all the upper and lower"a" characters in chewieQuote. Your regex does not need flags, and it should not match any of the other quotes.

Your regex chewieRegex should use the * character to match zero or more a characters.
Your regex chewieRegex should match 16 characters.
Your regex should match "Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa".
Your regex should not match any characters in "He made a fair move. Screaming about it can't help you."
Your regex should not match any characters in "Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee."
