Regular Expressions: Match Everything But Letters and Numbers
You've learned that you can use a shortcut to match alphanumerics [A-Za-z0-9_] using \w. A natural pattern you might want to search for is the opposite of alphanumerics.

You can search for the opposite of the \w with \W. Note, the opposite pattern uses a capital letter. This shortcut is the same as [^A-Za-z0-9_].

let shortHand = /\W/;
let numbers = "42%";
let sentence = "Coding!";
numbers.match(shortHand); // Returns ["%"]
sentence.match(shortHand); // Returns ["!"]

Use the shorthand character class \W to count the number of non-alphanumeric characters in various quotes and strings.

Your regex should use the global flag.
Your regex should find 6 non-alphanumeric characters in "The five boxing wizards jump quickly.".
Your regex should use the shorthand character.
Your regex should find 8 non-alphanumeric characters in "Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs."
Your regex should find 6 non-alphanumeric characters in "How vexingly quick daft zebras jump!"
Your regex should find 12 non-alphanumeric characters in "123 456 7890 ABC def GHI jkl MNO pqr STU vwx YZ."
