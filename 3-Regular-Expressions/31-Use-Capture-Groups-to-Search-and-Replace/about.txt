Regular Expressions: Use Capture Groups to Search and Replace
Searching is useful. However, you can make searching even more powerful when it also changes (or replaces) the text you match.

You can search and replace text in a string using .replace() on a string. The inputs for .replace() is first the regex pattern you want to search for. The second parameter is the string to replace the match or a function to do something.

let wrongText = "The sky is silver.";
let silverRegex = /silver/;
wrongText.replace(silverRegex, "blue");
// Returns "The sky is blue."
You can also access capture groups in the replacement string with dollar signs ($).

"Code Camp".replace(/(\w+)\s(\w+)/, '$2 $1');
// Returns "Camp Code"

Write a regex so that it will search for the string "good". Then update the replaceText variable to replace "good" with "okey-dokey".

You should use .replace() to search and replace.
Your regex should change "This sandwich is good." to "This sandwich is okey-dokey."
You should not change the last line.
