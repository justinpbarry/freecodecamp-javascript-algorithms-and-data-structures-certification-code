ES6: Use export to Reuse a Code Block
In the previous challenge, you learned about import and how it can be leveraged to import small amounts of code from large files. In order for this to work, though, we must utilize one of the statements that goes with import, known as export. When we want some code - a function, or a variable - to be usable in another file, we must export it in order to import it into another file. Like import, export is a non-browser feature.

The following is what we refer to as a named export. With this, we can import any code we export into another file with the import syntax you learned in the last lesson. Here's an example:

const capitalizeString = (string) => {
  return string.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + string.slice(1);
}
export { capitalizeString } //How to export functions.
export const foo = "bar"; //How to export variables.
Alternatively, if you would like to compact all your export statements into one line, you can take this approach:

const capitalizeString = (string) => {
  return string.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + string.slice(1);
}
const foo = "bar";
export { capitalizeString, foo }
Either approach is perfectly acceptable.


Below are two variables that I want to make available for other files to use. Utilizing the first way I demonstrated export, export the two variables.

foo is exported.
bar is exported.
