ES6: Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Objects
We saw earlier how spread operator can effectively spread, or unpack, the contents of the array.

We can do something similar with objects as well. Destructuring assignment is special syntax for neatly assigning values taken directly from an object to variables.

Consider the following ES5 code:

var voxel = {x: 3.6, y: 7.4, z: 6.54 };
var x = voxel.x; // x = 3.6
var y = voxel.y; // y = 7.4
var z = voxel.z; // z = 6.54
Here's the same assignment statement with ES6 destructuring syntax:

const { x, y, z } = voxel; // x = 3.6, y = 7.4, z = 6.54
If instead you want to store the values of voxel.x into a, voxel.y into b, and voxel.z into c, you have that freedom as well.

const { x : a, y : b, z : c } = voxel // a = 3.6, b = 7.4, c = 6.54
You may read it as "get the field x and copy the value into a," and so on.


Use destructuring to obtain the average temperature for tomorrow from the input object AVG_TEMPERATURES, and assign value with key tomorrow to tempOfTomorrow in line.

getTempOfTmrw(AVG_TEMPERATURES) should be 79
destructuring with reassignment was used

below is the original code that comes along with this challenge
CODE

const AVG_TEMPERATURES = {
  today: 77.5,
  tomorrow: 79
};

function getTempOfTmrw(avgTemperatures) {
  "use strict";
  // change code below this line
  const tempOfTomorrow = undefined; // change this line
  // change code above this line
  return tempOfTomorrow;
}

console.log(getTempOfTmrw(AVG_TEMPERATURES)); // should be 79
