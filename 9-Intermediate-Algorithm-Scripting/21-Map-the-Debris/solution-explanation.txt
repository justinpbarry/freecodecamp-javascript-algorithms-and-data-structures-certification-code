The basic logic is to add Earth's radius to avgHeight. I assume avgHeight is the distance from the K치rm치n line to the satelite. See below for info on the K치rm치n line

We then use Kepler's Third Law,
Using the equation T = 2 * pi * sqrt(a^3 / mew) where mu = GM (standard gravitational parameter)
the orbital period T (in seconds) of two point masses orbiting each other in a circular or elliptic orbit is:[2]
equation based on article in:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_period
For the special case of a circle, the lengths of the semi-axes are both equal to the radius of the circle.

Finally: aside from using the equation,
the larger the avgHeight, the longer it should take to go around because the the orbit will be longer.
